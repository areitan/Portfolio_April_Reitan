# Portfolio_April_Reitan


## Description

The task was to create a deployed portfolio website for my work that scales for different media screen sizes. This included creating an HTML file and a CSS file with no beginning code. I had a .gif file to work from with a suggested layout. Please see the example screenshot and my website screenshot below.

## Process

After creating a GitHub repository for this project, I drew out a sketch on paper of how the layout should look to look to match the example. Then I started creating an index.html file. I tried to break the example website up into logical blocks--the pieces from biggest to smallest--that were needed to recreate the same layout as the example picture. I started with the biggest blocks and worked my way down to the details. Then I worked through styling in the my style.css for layout, color scheme, and effects. See the links to my repository and the portfolio website below.

### Wireframing

1. I used pencil and paper to make a sketch of the website layout to determine the best way, using the tools I have a the moment, to acheive a similar layout to the example.


### index.html

1. I started a generic HTML document with DOCTYPE, HTML, head, and body.
2. I started by adding ```<meta>``` tags to the header for language and viewport size and a ```<link>``` to my style sheet "style.css".
3. In the body, I added a ```<header>``` tag with internal ```<na>``` links to the sections in the page, a heading, a background picture, and a picture of myself. 
4. I added a ```main``` tag for the main content of the page where I added 2 sections (About me and Work) and a footer for my contact info.
5. To the About Me section, I added an ```<h2>``` header and some text to tell about myself. 
6. To the Work section, I added an ```<h2>``` header used an ```<a>``` tag combined with an ```<img>``` tag to make images that are links to my repositories. Since I only have 2 as of the end of this project, the other links are to music to enjoy while you wait for my next projects.
7. I added text to use as titles for the picture links.
8. To the Contact Me footer, I added an ```<h2>``` header and some text and links to my email and GitHub profile.


### style.css

1. I added variables for common properties to make managing some of the styling easier.
2. I styled the header with a background image and used flex box to determine how the section should layout.
3. I added a media query at the end of the file so the website would display properly on different screen sizes.
4. I added styling and flex for the about-me, work, and contact-me classes. All three of these classes have the same styling for consistency.
5. Within the work section, I added a class I called grid to control the layout of the links to my work.
6. I gave the first work link an image that is larger than the others.
7. I added positioning and styling in order to place text from the HTML as a title or caption on top of the images which are links to my work.
6. I styled the first application image to be larger than the others.
7. I added a media query at the end of the style.css file so that the page will display differently for different screen sizes.
8. I added a pseudo-class ```:hover``` selector to my links and images in my work and contact me sections to add a border and/or change the background color when the cursor hovers over them. 


## How To Contribute

In order to create this website, I used the skills I have at the moment. I am open to suggestions, if there are ways to streamline the code.
